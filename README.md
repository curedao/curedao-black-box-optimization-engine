# A Control Systems Engineering Approach to Precision Medicine

To determine effects of various factors on health outcomes, we currently apply pharmacokinetic modeling over various onset delay and duration of action 
hyper-parameters and combine that with some other parameters for each of Hill's criteria for causality.  

The distributions in this type of data aren't super normal, and you've got the onset delays and durations of action so regular Pearson correlations don't work so well. So we mainly focus on change from baseline. There's a ton of room for improvement by controlling using instrumental variables or convolutional recursive neural networks.

Hybrid Predictive Control Black Box Models seem most appropriate. This repository is for storing potential alternative implementations.
